# Week 8: Data Persistence Using Firebase

**Name:** Vinly G. Tolentino <br/>
**Section:** U-2L <br/>
**Student number:** 2022 - 10929 <br/>

## Code Description

The Slambook app is an application that allows users to manage a list of friends. Users can add new friends, edit existing friend details, view friend information, and delete friends from the list. All friend data is stored in Firebase.

## Things you did in the code

1. Manage folders depending on their functionality (screens, models, providers, api).
2. Translate Exercise 4, where data are passed using routes, to an app that uses provider that centralized all the data.
3. Utilization of firebase to save data in the cloud. 

## Challenges encountered

1. Adding provider and api to my existing app.
